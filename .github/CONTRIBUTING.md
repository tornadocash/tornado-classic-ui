# Welcome to TornadoCash!

If you're submitting code to TornadoCash, there are some simple things we'd appreciate you doing to help us stay organized!

### Finding the right project

Before taking the time to code and implement something, feel free to open an issue and discuss it! There may even be an issue already open, and together we may come up with a specific strategy before you take your precious time to write code.

### Submitting a pull request
Please try not to include multiple features in a single PR, and don't make extraneous changes outside the scope of your contribution. All those touched files make things harder to review.

And that's it! Thanks for helping out.
